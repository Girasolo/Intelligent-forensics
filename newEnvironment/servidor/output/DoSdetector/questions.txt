1) in tcptrace how do I calculate the difference of time in cases in which a connection is opened but never closed and viceversa?
2) - where can I find the compiled model?
3) - to Ionut: shall I also copy the transformation parameters? precisely the scaler, which, as I understood, would answer to the last question present in the code
4) how is it better to test attacks? 
5) should I send the admin the integral files or can I just send the line to be tested? Shall I group them and then send them (for example store the lines of every 0.5 sec and send them when the admin ask for it)?
6) until now it seems to me that I didn't do anything different from your work. How can I diversificate it?
